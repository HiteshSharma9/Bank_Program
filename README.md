# Bank_Program
I created a Java application. The user was given options to deposit their money which was meant to be saved in the database (database made in MySQL on my local pc). They also had the option to withdraw their money which would update the database entries.

This is just the main code. The program uploaded won't work as it was designed to work on local database on my pc.
I may or may not make a change to the program for having an inbuilt or separatly created database file.
